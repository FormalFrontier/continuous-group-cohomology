# Discrete direct sums and tensor products of topological representations

The algebraic actions are `Representation.directSum` and `Representation.tprod`.
Each resulting topological representation uses the discrete topology on its
algebraic carrier. Joint continuity of the acting monoid is a separate property
from continuity of its individual operators.
